Question 1: 
For given JSON iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, for each)

Answer:
Once the JSON array is converted into a JavaScript object, you can use a loop such as a for loop, a forEach loop, or a forâ€¦in loop to iterate through each object in the array.

During each iteration, you can access the properties of each JSON object using the dot notation or bracket notation


Example: 


let person = {
    'firstName': 'Jayachandran',
    'lastName': 'Kumarsamy',
    'age': 27,
    'isStudent': true,
    'hobbies': ['programming', 'reading', 'fishing']
};


for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key, person[key]);
}

console.log(Object.keys);



Answer:

firstName Jayachandran
lastName Kumarsamy
age 27
isStudent true
hobbies [ 'programming', 'reading', 'fishing' ]
[Function: keys]
